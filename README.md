**Overview**
The Burger Sales Report Analysis project is a SQL-based analysis tool designed to extract meaningful insights from a database containing orders and runner information. This project aims to facilitate decision-making and provide actionable insights for a hypothetical burger delivery service.

**Features**

1.Order Retrieval with Runner's Registration Date
Retrieves each order from the database along with the corresponding registration date of the runner.

2.Burger Names with Order IDs
Retrieves the names of burgers ordered along with their respective order IDs, enhancing order details for further analysis.

3.Total Orders and Average Distance Covered by Runners
Calculates the total number of orders handled by each runner and computes the average distance covered by each runner, aiding in performance evaluation.

4.Orders with Distance Greater Than 5 km
Lists all orders along with the registration date of the runner and filters those where the distance covered exceeds 5 km, focusing on longer deliveries.

5.Runners with No Canceled Orders
Identifies and lists runners who have not canceled any orders, providing insights into reliability and customer satisfaction.

**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of burger sales and delivery operations. By leveraging SQL queries, the project extracts pertinent data points that help stakeholders understand performance metrics such as delivery distances, order frequencies, and runner reliability. These insights can inform strategic decisions to optimize delivery routes, improve service efficiency, and enhance overall customer experience.

**Usage**
This project's SQL files can be utilized to run queries against a compatible database schema containing tables for orders, burgers, runners, and related information. Users can adapt and extend the queries to suit specific business requirements and integrate them into reporting tools or analytics dashboards.
